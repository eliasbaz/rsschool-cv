> At the moment, I am working as an engineer at a design institute. After more than a year of work I realize that this is not mine at all, that there is no growth, no development, I do not enjoy the work process. That's why I want to change my current profession and connect my life with IT, especially I want to do Front End Development.

> After graduation, I want to get into an IT company and further develop as a developer and designer.
I'm a sociable and responsible person. I work well in stressful situations and in company with people, easy to learn.
I have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, familiar with JQuery. 
At the moment I am taking courses at RS School, online courses from HtmlAcademy, as well as several tests. 

> I have experience of single page layout on pure HTML/CSS. 
No experience in the company, software development, etc.

> I have higher education in the specialty "Automation and telemechanics on railway transport", I also study on trainings from EPAM company together with RS School.

>English proficiency at medium level.
